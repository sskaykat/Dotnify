### Infrastructure

- Hono-based API backend with Upstash Redis for state storage
- Password-based admin authentication with scrypt hashing
- Redis-backed rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- Security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- Vercel Serverless deployment support
- Docker deployment support (linux/amd64 + linux/arm64)
- Self-hosting support via `npm start` (Node.js / Docker / Railway)

### Bug Fixes

- Vercel routing: API requests were served as HTML due to SPA fallback taking priority
- Vercel function: use named HTTP method exports for Node.js runtime
- Vercel function: use `createRequire` to load JSON without import attribute (Node.js 24)
- Limit username and password length to prevent scrypt DoS
- Replace in-memory rate limiter with Redis-backed implementation (ineffective on serverless)
- Use Redis `SET NX` to atomically create admin, prevent setup race condition
